This modules replaces the default authentication on this Django project.
For doing so, Settings.py is changed to:


''' AUTH_USER_MODEL = "users.User"


You may also install google-identity-toolkit, that as I write this readme still not compatible with Python3.
to install on Python3, you may download my adapted version on https://github.com/vmenezes/identity-toolkit-python-client


To install from the downloaded version:


''' pip3 install /folder/of/forked/version
